#Stage1 of checking 
#With 5 layers the model stoped at approx 35000 loss , trying to reduce the number of results

#Stage2 of checking 
#Now with the 4 layers still the same result, Lets try normalizing the dataset and reducing the number of layers and try seeing through graphs what might went wrong 
#Still not wroking properly lets move to Stage3 with rmse test to see the actual issue

#Stage 3
#The model is working fine but lets move to the thrid version, i tried increasing the synthetic dataset and included every possible possibility
